The complex mod.
This mod will allow you to connect Factories into a single "Complex", where their production power is focused.
I got the idea for this mod, when I was shipping goods between ~15 of my own factories and felt too bored to continue. From my game experience of the x-Series(The space sim, not X-COM) I knew complexes would be the solution.
