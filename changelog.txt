[0.89]
- Fixed crashes and general weird behavior with asynchronous Entity changes (This is what broke v0.88 since Avorion 0.13)[The build menu needs a manual input(button press/slider change/station selection) to properly show the next build phase]
- Founding-stations for complexes can now have a different rootIndex than 0 (The whole mechanic behind got a lot more forgiving)
- The stretching of the connections, when adding new stations in a single direction is now gone (New stations will still always be outside of the complexes Bounding Box, but without unused space)
- Overview tab keeps correct colors when changing priority
- Alliance permissions system is now implemented, but NOT ACTIVATED. It needs further testing, so no abuse can be made
- Factories that need no ingredients and produce no garbage, but have >1 product(Noble-Metal-Mines, Gas-Collectors, ...), will now continue producing, if there is space for at least one product.
- Moved to /mods/ directory. If you have Complexes in your Galaxy follow the updated installation instructions!
- The construction Tab now shows the name of the subfactory you are currently connecting to
- NPC trading is now integrated into the mod. It can be disabled via the /mods/complexMod/config/config.lua file. (works with Better Docking http://www.avorion.net/forum/index.php/topic,3892.0.html)
